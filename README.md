Welcome to the 5e Complete module for Foundry VTT! This module adds the classes, races, spells, and other resources that are missing from the 5e System Reference Document (SRD). With this module installed you'll have access to everything you need to run a complete 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons campaign within Foundry VTT.

## Installation
In Foundry's Install Module menu, copy the following link into the Manifest URL field:

```
https://github.com/btbias/5e-complete/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

## Features
5e Complete is a collection of compendiums that operate identically to the SRD compendiums. Simply open the compendium with the desired content, ex. **5e Classes**, and click an item to view it, or click and drag it to a character to apply it.

All classes and their subclasses leverage Foundry's built-in advancement tables. When you level up, you'll have features and spells granted by your class or subclass added to your character automatically.

Each item will have a Source value tied to the volume it came from, such as `TCE` for Tasha's Cauldron of Everything. Any items from 3rd-party sources will be marked with an asterisk (\*), such as `KCCC*` for Kibble's Compendium of Craft and Creation.

### Disclaimers
- This is a work in progress. Some content may be missing or have errors. Please submit a [new issue](https://github.com/btbias/5e-complete/issues) if you have any issues.
- The best method for including creature artwork has not been decided yet.
